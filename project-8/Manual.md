Manual 

For our project 8, we added some fun new features:

    Random composition generator 
    Transpose up an octave
    Transpose down an octave 
    C# Mode

On top of these new functionalities, we refactored our code and gave the background of the TuneComposer a little makeover! There is a new color theme and now sharps/flats are marked on the note pane, alongside middle C (C4) to make writing tunes a little more straightfoward. This was done so that the note pane would more closely mirror an actual piano keyboard.

For the random composition generator, the user just clicks the option from the Fun menu and a completely randomized composition with random instruments and notes will appear on the note pane ready to play.

For transposing up and down and octave, whatever is selected on the note pane will be shifted up and down an octave. This option can be found in the Fun menu. 

C# mode plays your composition in all C# in its respective octave without changing any notes on the pane.
