Here's how to use git in the terminal

To clone directory:
Navigate to desired directory. Then:

git clone https://github.com/WhitmanSWDesignSpring2018/project-5-8-teamjuan.git

To open files in VSCode and run TuneComposer:

cd ../route-to-cloned-dir/project-5-teamjuam/src/
git checkout master
git pull
code .
javac tunecomposer/*.java
java tunecomposer.TuneComposer


To switch branches:
  If creating a new branch:

git checkout -b branchname

  If switching to already created branch:

git checkout branchname


To commit to GitHub from Terminal:

git checkout branchname
git add tunecomposer/*
git commit -m "commit message"
git push

Then go to GitHub and create a pull request. 
If there is a merge conflict:

git checkout master
git pull
git checkout branchname
git merge master

Then fix merge conflicts in VSCode and commit changes:

git add tunecomposer/*
git commit -m "commit message"
git push

Then someone can merge the pull request. 
Remember to pull from master again once pull request is merged!

git checkout master
git pull
